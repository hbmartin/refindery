## Workflow

Always run ruff and pytest and ty and pyrefly and lizard (with uv) after making any changes

## Development Notes

- The project supports Python 3.13+
- Uses uv for dependency management instead of traditional pip/setuptools
- Code style uses Ruff formatter and linter

## Python Practices
- Always use or add type hints
- Prefer @dataclasses where applicable
- Always use f-string over string formatting or concatentation (except in logging strings)
- Use async generators and comprehensions when they might provide benefits
- Use underscores in large numeric literals
- Use walrus assignment := where applicable
- Prefer to use named arguments when calling a method with more than one argument
- Use "list" instead of "List" and "dict" instead of "Dict" and "|" instead of "Union" for types
- Use "Self" for applicable types
- Use Structural Pattern Matching (match...case) where applicable
- Always use pathlib.Path for file operations, never use os.path
- Inputs (e.g. HTTP requests) and call results (e.g. HTTP requests not already wrapped in a library) must be validated and made type safe with pydantic.

# Notes

- Composition root is `application/container.py::build_container`; tests wire fakes via `tests/fakes/container.py::build_test_container` (real SQLite/LanceDB/huey/DuckDB, fake embedder/reranker/fetcher). API tests drive the app with `httpx.ASGITransport` inside `app.router.lifespan_context(app)`.
- `DuckDbSink` executes registered DDL at `start()` — construct `DuckDbQueryLog(sink)` (registers tables) before `sink.start()`.
- duckdb's Python client needs pytz to fetch TIMESTAMPTZ columns; select `epoch_us(ts)` and rebuild UTC datetimes instead (see `DuckDbQueryLogReader`).
- Search ranking only exists after fusion → rerank → rollup → hydrate; pagination/limits must be applied at the final slice in `SearchService.search`, never pushed into the vector-store arms.
- Auth: `require_read`/`require_write` in `api/auth.py`; routers get read globally in `app.py`, mutating routes add `dependencies=[Depends(require_write)]`. MCP tool calls replay over HTTP with the caller's token, so scopes apply on every transport; `enable_mutating_tools` is visibility-only.
- CLI is argparse in `src/refindery/cli.py` (`refindery serve|eval score|eval replay`); no subcommand defaults to serve so `python -m refindery` keeps working.
- Ruff (select=ALL) gotchas seen here: ASYNC110 (no while-await-sleep polling loops with empty bodies), ASYNC240 (no pathlib calls in async defs), S110 (except-pass needs noqa). Tests get per-file-ignores for ANN001/ANN201/ARG001/PLC0415 etc. but NOT ANN202/ANN205/ARG002/A002/EM102/E501 — annotate private helpers and stub methods in tests too.
- lizard threshold in CI: CCN > 15 on `src` only.
- Provider resilience lives in `adapters/resilience/` (CircuitBreaker/BreakerRegistry keyed per provider failure domain, `call_with_retry`, `ResilientEmbedder`/`ResilientReranker` wrapping the ports; `guarded_call` also used inside `OpenAiCompatClient`). Fakes in `tests/fakes/` stay unwrapped. Breaker-open (`ProviderUnavailableError`) job failures requeue WITHOUT incrementing attempts (`huey_queue._execute`); search degrades to fusion-only on rerank failure, `/v1/compare` fails loudly on purpose.
- `_execute` bounds handlers with `asyncio.timeout` (`jobs.handler_timeout_s`, default = lease); `lease_timeout.expired()` distinguishes a lease cancellation from a provider TimeoutError that escaped the handler. The lease watchdog periodic is observe-only — never re-enqueue while the process lives (a zombie thread may still be mid-write; single-writer invariant).
- `# type: ignore[...]` does NOT suppress ty — this repo uses `# ty: ignore[...]` / `# pyrefly: ignore[...]` (see gliner_spacy.py). Faking an optional module in tests: `module = types.ModuleType("x"); module.__dict__["Attr"] = ...` (plain attribute assignment fails ty/pyrefly), then `monkeypatch.setitem(sys.modules, "x", module)`.
- Annotations are evaluated eagerly (py313, no `from __future__ import annotations`): a module-level helper annotated with a class defined later in the file NameErrors at import — define helpers after the dataclasses they reference.
- YouTube ingest: `_build_fetcher` (container) wraps `HttpFetcher` in `RoutingFetcher` (`application/services/fetch_router.py`) that sends `is_youtube_url` URLs (`domain/youtube.py`) to `YoutubeCaptionFetcher` (`adapters/extraction/youtube_fetcher.py`, `youtube` extra → yt-dlp lazy import). The fetcher produces the final transcript (captions parsed by `youtube_captions.py`, else audio → `Transcriber` port: mlx-whisper on Apple Silicon / faster-whisper elsewhere, `transcribe-mlx`/`transcribe` extras) and wraps it in a `YoutubeTranscriptEnvelope` JSON body with synthetic content-type `application/x-youtube-transcript+json`. The core (dep-free) `YoutubeTranscriptExtractor` unwraps it → `ExtractedContent(body_text, title)`; this is the trick that carries the video title through `handle_fetch_and_index`'s `extracted.title` without adding a `title` field to `FetchResult`. yt-dlp's untyped info dict is validated with a `_VideoInfo` pydantic model before use. All gated on optional extras (added to deptry DEP002); missing extras fall back to the HTML path.
- Local dev: the `ner` extra's `en-core-web-sm` wheel is a GitHub-release URL source that the sandbox proxy blocks (403); editing `pyproject.toml` makes uv want to re-lock (which re-fetches it). Use `uv sync --frozen --group dev` to install from the existing lock without re-resolving. The package mirror can also be flaky (`tunnel error`) — retry syncs; uv caches per-package progress.
- Docs: Zensical site configured in `zensical.toml` (repo root, `[project]`-scoped TOML, not mkdocs.yml). Content under `docs/`; nav is explicit. Build with `uv run zensical build --clean --strict` (the CI gate in `.github/workflows/docs.yml` → GitHub Pages), preview with `uv run zensical serve`. `--strict` aborts on missing nav targets or broken internal links, and it renders *every* `.md` under `docs/` (not just nav'd ones). The `docs`/`docs = [...]` dependency group has `zensical` + `mkdocstrings[python]`. Python API pages use `::: dotted.path` (mkdocstrings/griffe, static — never imports the heavy extras); `paths = ["src"]` in the plugin config is repo-relative. Zensical plugin config is written raw under `[project.plugins.<name>...]` and wrapped internally. Emoji/material icons need `[project.markdown_extensions.pymdownx.emoji]` with `zensical.extensions.emoji.to_svg`/`twemoji`, or `:material-*:` shortcodes render literally.
